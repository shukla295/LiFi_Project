# 💡 Li-Fi Based Data Transmission System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates **Li-Fi (Light Fidelity)** technology, a wireless communication system that uses **visible light** instead of radio waves to transmit data. Data is transmitted through **LED light intensity modulation** and received using a **photo detector**.

Li-Fi offers higher data security, reduced interference, and efficient spectrum usage compared to traditional Wi-Fi systems.

## 🧠 Working Principle
1. Input data is converted into digital signals  
2. LED light blinks at high speed (not visible to human eye)  
3. Photo diode detects light intensity variations  
4. Receiver circuit decodes the signal back into data
